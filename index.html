            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Jan Hrček. Since 2009 I hold a master’s degree in Computer Science from Masaryk University, <a href="https://www.muni.cz/en/about-us/organizational-structure/faculty-of-informatics">Faculty of Informatics</a>.</p>
            <p>I work as a Haskell developer at <a href="https://www.holmusk.com/">Holmusk</a> remotely from Brno, Czech Republic. The primary focus of my job is the development and maintenance of the <a href="https://www.neuroblu.ai/">NeuroBlu</a>, behavioral health data research platform.</p>
            <p>I am Functional Programming enthusiast with several years of experience using <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> and <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> languages in many hobby and work-related <a href="./projects.html">projects</a>. I firmly believe that Purely Functional Programming is THE way to write robust and reliable software that stays maintainable over long periods of time. Here is an incomplete list of technologies I use on daily basis and am comfortable/proficient with: Linux (mostly Fedora and occasionally playing with Nix), Haskell (GHC, Stack, Cabal), Elm, Graphviz, Docker, AWS, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Git, HTML, CSS, Vim. In the past I also did a lot of Java, Maven, Jenkins, Jira, GWT (Google Web Toolkit), Selenium, IntelliJ IDEA, …</p>
            <p>I am experienced Java programmer, holder of <em>Oracle Certified Associate, Java SE 7 Programmer</em> and <em>Oracle Certified Professional, Java SE 7 Programmer</em> certificates, but since discovering the power of Purely Functional Programming I don’t fancy doing Java as much as I used to.</p>
            <p>I also love learning stuff about Mathematics, in particular Algebra, Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Category Theory.</p>
            <p>I am native Czech speaker, but am also fluent in English (holder of Cambridge <em>FCE</em> certificate) and I am intermediate German speaker.</p>
            <p>You can find more about me in my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-hrcek-b5147822/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jhrcek">GitHub</a> profiles.</p>
